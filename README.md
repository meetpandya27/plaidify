## 🔗 What is Plaidify?

Plaidify is an open-source platform that lets developers programmatically **connect to any website protected by a standard login form**.

It abstracts away the quirks of individual sites and exposes a **unified API** to:

- Establish a user-authorized session
- Execute the site-specific login flow defined in a _blueprint_
- Return structured data selected by the author of that blueprint

If a site has no public API, Plaidify gives you a repeatable way to obtain the data your users already have permission to access — with **zero changes** to the target site.

## 🎯 Key Features

| Capability           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Universal Login**  | Works with any site using username/email + password authentication.          |
| **Blueprint-Driven** | Each site’s flow is defined in a small JSON file. No custom code per site.  |
| **Unified API**      | `/connect`, `/status`, and `/disconnect` endpoints keep integration simple.  |
| **Session Isolation**| Every connection runs in its own sandbox, ensuring data separation & safety. |
| **Extensible**       | Python 3.9+, ready for secret vaults, OTP handlers, or AI helpers.           |
| **Open License**     | MIT licensed — use it in personal, SaaS, or enterprise projects.             |

                                             4. Extract Structured Data

```

- Input: `site`, `username`, `password`
- Plaidify reads the matching JSON blueprint in `/connectors/`
- The connection engine performs the site-specific steps (fields, buttons, waits)
- Defined data points are captured and normalized
- Your app receives a clean JSON payload

## 📦 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/meetpandya/plaidify.git
cd plaidify

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the API
uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# 4. Explore
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for the interactive Swagger UI.
```

**Sample POST /connect**

```json
{
  "site": "demo_site",
  "username": "demo_user",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```

**Sample Response**

```json
{
  "status": "connected",
  "data": {
    "profile_status": "active",
    "last_synced": "2025-04-17T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 🔗 Plaidify "Link Token" Flow

As an alternative to the single-step `/connect`, Plaidify supports a multi-step flow inspired by Plaid:

1. **Create a link token for the desired site:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/create_link?site=mock_site"
   ```
   Returns: `{"link_token": "<link_token>"}`

2. **Submit credentials for that link token:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit_credentials?link_token=<link_token>&username=mock_user&password=mock_password"
   ```
   Returns: `{"access_token": "<access_token>"}`

3. **Fetch data with your access token:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/fetch_data?access_token=<access_token>"
   ```
   This triggers the site’s login flow according to the JSON blueprint in `/connectors/`, then returns extracted data.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

| Requirement         | Notes                                         |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Python 3.9+         | Confirm with `python --version`.             |
| pip / poetry        | Any modern Python package manager.           |
| (Optional) Docker   | A `docker-compose.yml` is included for containerized runs. |

## 🧩 Connector Blueprints

Each file in `/connectors/` fully describes how Plaidify should interact with a given site.

**Example: `connectors/demo_site.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "Demo Site",
  "login_url": "https://demo.example.com/login",
  "fields": {
    "username": "#user",
    "password": "#pass",
    "submit":   "#login-btn"
  },
  "post_login": [
    { "wait": "#dashboard" },
    { "extract": {
        "profile_status": "#status",
        "last_synced":    "#last-sync"
    }}
  ]
}
```

Add a new site by dropping in a JSON file and restarting Plaidify — no code changes needed.

## 🔐 Security by Design

- **Ephemeral Credentials** – Used only for the active session and then discarded.
- **No Logging of Secrets** – Sensitive fields are never written to disk or stdout.
- **Vault Ready** – Planned integrations for HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager.
- **Blueprint Isolation** – Each connector’s scope is limited to its own sandbox, preventing cross-site data leakage.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] OTP / email code workflows
- [ ] Secure vault plugins
- [ ] Admin dashboard for monitoring connections
- [ ] Automated blueprint generator (AI-assisted)
- [ ] Connection health analytics & alerting
